## Page 63 - Getting key input from the user
The following sentence:
"This method waits for the user to type some text, then as soon as the user presses Enter, whatever the user has typed is returned as a string value."
Should be:
"This method waits for the user to press a key or key combination and that is then returned as a ConsoleKeyInfo value."
